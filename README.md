<h1>Remittance</h1>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
Implemented ability to create new wallets and provide transactions between them. Transactions are available only for wallets with the same currency. From RUB to RUB - good, from RUB to USD - wrong. When user sends money from his wallet to his another wallet - no commission, and when he sends to wallet, related to another user - commission=10%.
Transactions and wallets creation are available only for logged users.
